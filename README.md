## Questions & Clarifications
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### üë§ Chief Financial Officer (CFO)

#### üí¨ Q1: What is our gross profit margin, and is it healthy?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Yes, very healthy.  
**Gross Profit** = ‚Ç¶12,436,500 (Total Sales) ‚Äì ‚Ç¶3,988,846.45 (Total Drug Cost) = **‚Ç¶8,447,653.55**  
**Gross Margin** = (‚Ç¶8,447,653.55 / ‚Ç¶12,436,500) √ó 100 = **~67.9%**  
This is a strong margin, suggesting that pricing is efficient and overhead costs are being managed effectively.

#### üí¨ Q2: Which drug categories are most and least profitable?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
While detailed per-category profitability data requires unit cost per category, top-line sales give an indication:  
- **Top Revenue Generators:** Antihistamines (‚Ç¶1.85M) and Antidiabetics (‚Ç¶1.78M)  
- **Lowest Performer:** Antifungals (‚Ç¶225K)  

Assuming similar markup across categories, Antifungals are likely less profitable and may be overstocked or under-demanded.

#### üí¨ Q3: What are the biggest contributors to our overall expenses?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
- **Drug Procurement:** ‚Ç¶3.99M (59.4% of all expenses)  
- **Salaries:** ‚Ç¶2M (29.8%)  
- **Other Costs (Rent, Logistics, Damage):** 10.8%

#### üí¨ Q4: Can procurement costs be optimized?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Yes. High procurement costs, especially in categories like **Antimalarials** (‚Ç¶334,574 in costs), indicate room for negotiation.  
**Recommendation:**  
- Renegotiate bulk deals  
- Explore alternative suppliers for better pricing

### üë§ Head of Inventory

#### üí¨ Q5: Which drug categories are in highest demand?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
**Top Sellers:**  
- Antihistamines (‚Ç¶1.85M)  
- Antidiabetics (‚Ç¶1.78M)  
- Analgesics (‚Ç¶1.6M)  

This implies high patient need ‚Äî possibly seasonal (allergies) or chronic (diabetes).

#### üí¨ Q6: Which items are moving too slowly and may risk expiry?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
**Antifungals**, with just ‚Ç¶225K in sales, are significantly underperforming.  
This may indicate overstock or misaligned inventory planning.  
**Action:** Consider reduced ordering or promotional clearance.

### üë§ Marketing Lead

#### üí¨ Q7: Are seasonal conditions influencing drug sales?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Yes.  
**Harmattan season** likely drove high Antihistamine sales due to respiratory allergies.  
This suggests marketing efforts should shift dynamically with the climate.

#### üí¨ Q8: Which categories are worth promoting more?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
- **Antidiabetics**: High sellers with consistent demand (chronic conditions)  
- **Analgesics & Antiseptics**: Strong volumes  

These are stable revenue drivers and ideal for cross-promotions and loyalty campaigns.

#### üí¨ Q9: How can marketing reduce inventory risk for slow-moving products?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Promotional campaigns targeting **Antifungals** (low sales) can increase awareness.  
**Suggestions:**  
- Combo offers  
- Bundles  
- Pharmacy advice sessions

### üë§ Operations Manager

#### üí¨ Q10: How much loss are we incurring from expired or damaged drugs?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
‚Ç¶60,000 in January ‚Äî less than 1% of total expenses, but still a preventable cost.  
Frequent minor losses may accumulate over time.

#### üí¨ Q11: How can we reduce losses from expiry?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Implement the **FEFO (First Expiry, First Out)** inventory system across all stock.  
This ensures older stock is sold first, reducing expiry risk.

#### üí¨ Q12: Is logistics spending proportional to our delivery volume?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
‚Ç¶210,000 (3.1% of total expenses) is within reason but worth reviewing if volume is low.  
**Action:** Benchmark delivery volume vs. spend to validate cost efficiency.

## Recommendations

1. Ensure a stable supply of high-demand drugs, especially antiallergic (during harmattan) and antidiabetic medications, to meet patient needs and avoid stockouts.

2. Reduce drug costs by negotiating better terms with current suppliers, sourcing affordable alternatives through market research, and purchasing high-demand, long-shelf-life drugs in bulk.

3. Prevent drug wastage by applying the FEFO (First Expiry, First Out) rule to prioritize the dispensing of medications nearing expiration.
