## 6. Conclusion & Recommendations

### 6.1 Key Findings

b. Drug purchase accounts for the largest portion of expenses.

c. Despite high revenue, reducing procurement costs can improve profitability.

### 6.2 Recommendations

#### 1. Increase Inventory for High-Demand Drugs (Antiallergies, Antidiabetic)

Ensuring a stable supply of essential medications, particularly antiallergic and antidiabetic drugs, is crucial to meeting patient demand and avoiding stockouts. These categories of drugs are consistently in high demand , with the former, due to the harmattan season, and the latter due to the prevalence of diabetes.

#### 2. Optimize Procurement Strategies to Reduce Drug Costs

To optimize procurement and reduce drug costs,  prices with existing suppliers can be negotiated better to secure bulk purchase discounts and flexible payment terms. Exploring new suppliers through market research can also help identify cost-effective options while maintaining quality standards. Additionally, buying in bulk for high-demand drugs with long shelf lives lowers per-unit costs and ensures a steady supply, preventing stockouts and enhancing cost efficiency.

#### 3. Apply FEFO Rule (First Expiry, First Out) to Prevent Drug Expiry

The First Expiry, First Out (FEFO) rule ensures that medications with the nearest expiration dates are dispensed first, preventing waste due to expired stock.
