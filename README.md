## Analysis & Insights

## Questions & Clarifications
### üë§ Chief Financial Officer (CFO)

#### üí¨ Q1: What is our gross profit margin, and is it healthy?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Yes, very healthy.  
**Gross Profit** = ‚Ç¶12,436,500 (Total Sales) ‚Äì ‚Ç¶3,988,846.45 (Total Drug Cost) = **‚Ç¶8,447,653.55**  
**Gross Margin** = (‚Ç¶8,447,653.55 / ‚Ç¶12,436,500) √ó 100 = **~67.9%**  
This is a strong margin, suggesting that pricing is efficient and overhead costs are being managed effectively.

#### üí¨ Q2: Which drug categories are most and least profitable?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
While detailed per-category profitability data requires unit cost per category, top-line sales give an indication:  
- **Top Revenue Generators:** Antihistamines (‚Ç¶1.85M) and Antidiabetics (‚Ç¶1.78M)  
- **Lowest Performer:** Antifungals (‚Ç¶225K)  

Assuming similar markup across categories, Antifungals are likely less profitable and may be overstocked or under-demanded.

#### üí¨ Q3: What are the biggest contributors to our overall expenses?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
- **Drug Procurement:** ‚Ç¶3.99M (59.4% of all expenses)  
- **Salaries:** ‚Ç¶2M (29.8%)  
- **Other Costs (Rent, Logistics, Damage):** 10.8%

#### üí¨ Q4: Can procurement costs be optimized?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Yes. High procurement costs, especially in categories like **Antimalarials** (‚Ç¶334,574 in costs), indicate room for negotiation.  
**Recommendation:**  
- Renegotiate bulk deals  
- Explore alternative suppliers for better pricing

### üë§ Head of Inventory

#### üí¨ Q5: Which drug categories are in highest demand?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
**Top Sellers:**  
- Antihistamines (‚Ç¶1.85M)  
- Antidiabetics (‚Ç¶1.78M)  
- Analgesics (‚Ç¶1.6M)  

This implies high patient need ‚Äî possibly seasonal (allergies) or chronic (diabetes).

#### üí¨ Q6: Which items are moving too slowly and may risk expiry?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
**Antifungals**, with just ‚Ç¶225K in sales, are significantly underperforming.  
This may indicate overstock or misaligned inventory planning.  
**Action:** Consider reduced ordering or promotional clearance.

#### üí¨ Q7: Are current inventory levels aligned with sales demand?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
**Partially.** While top categories are moving well, stock alignment may be suboptimal for low-volume products.  
**Action:**  
- Implement regular stock-to-sales analysis  
- Adopt a demand-driven restocking model

### üë§ Marketing Lead

#### üí¨ Q8: Are seasonal conditions influencing drug sales?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Yes.  
**Harmattan season** likely drove high Antihistamine sales due to respiratory allergies.  
This suggests marketing efforts should shift dynamically with the climate.

#### üí¨ Q9: Which categories are worth promoting more?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
- **Antidiabetics**: High sellers with consistent demand (chronic conditions)  
- **Analgesics & Antiseptics**: Strong volumes  

These are stable revenue drivers and ideal for cross-promotions and loyalty campaigns.

#### üí¨ Q10: How can marketing reduce inventory risk for slow-moving products?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Promotional campaigns targeting **Antifungals** (low sales) can increase awareness.  
**Suggestions:**  
- Combo offers  
- Bundles  
- Pharmacy advice sessions

### üë§ Operations Manager

#### üí¨ Q11: How much loss are we incurring from expired or damaged drugs?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
‚Ç¶60,000 in January ‚Äî less than 1% of total expenses, but still a preventable cost.  
Frequent minor losses may accumulate over time.

#### üí¨ Q12: How can we reduce losses from expiry?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
Implement the **FEFO (First Expiry, First Out)** inventory system across all stock.  
This ensures older stock is sold first, reducing expiry risk.

#### üí¨ Q13: Is logistics spending proportional to our delivery volume?
‚û°Ô∏è **A:**  
‚Ç¶210,000 (3.1% of total expenses) is within reason but worth reviewing if volume is low.  
**Action:** Benchmark delivery volume vs. spend to validate cost efficiency.


#### 1. Increase Inventory for High-Demand Drugs (Antiallergies, Antidiabetic)

Ensuring a stable supply of essential medications, particularly antiallergic and antidiabetic drugs, is crucial to meeting patient demand and avoiding stockouts. These categories of drugs are consistently in high demand , with the former, due to the harmattan season, and the latter due to the prevalence of diabetes.

#### 2. Optimize Procurement Strategies to Reduce Drug Costs

To optimize procurement and reduce drug costs,  prices with existing suppliers can be negotiated better to secure bulk purchase discounts and flexible payment terms. Exploring new suppliers through market research can also help identify cost-effective options while maintaining quality standards. Additionally, buying in bulk for high-demand drugs with long shelf lives lowers per-unit costs and ensures a steady supply, preventing stockouts and enhancing cost efficiency.

#### 3. Apply FEFO Rule (First Expiry, First Out) to Prevent Drug Expiry

The First Expiry, First Out (FEFO) rule ensures that medications with the nearest expiration dates are dispensed first, preventing waste due to expired stock.
